# project-23-Infinity-Scroll-Unsplash-API

## Description

A showcase website which implements infinity scroll feature and it consumes image data from Unsplash API to populate image container dynamically in the DOM. When user scroll down and
almost reach the bottom, new content is automatically loaded
which result to an infinity scroll effect. To achieve this project, I manipulate DOM element's properties like document.body.offsetHeight, document.body.scrollTop and window object's properties like window.innerHeight, window.scrollY.

## Stack

Javascript, HTML, CSS
